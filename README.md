# Keylogger-using-Python
The goal of the "Keylogger" project is to create a software application that captures and records keystrokes on a computer. This tool logs all keyboard inputs, enabling the monitoring and analysis of user activity.

**Keylogger Project**

Overview

The "Keylogger" project aims to develop a software application that records keystrokes on a computer. This tool captures and logs all keyboard inputs, which can be used for monitoring and analyzing user activity. The main goal is to demonstrate the potential risks and ethical concerns associated with keylogging technology, emphasizing the importance of cybersecurity measures to prevent unauthorized monitoring.
Purpose

This project focuses on educating users about the dangers of keyloggers, how they operate, and the significance of maintaining secure computing environments to protect sensitive information. By understanding how keyloggers work and their implications, users can take proactive steps to safeguard their privacy and security online.

**Features**

 Keystroke Logging: Records all keyboard inputs and saves them to a designated text file (key_log.txt).
    Special Key Handling: Handles special keys like space and enter appropriately for clear logging.
    User-Friendly Operation: Simple setup and execution for educational and demonstrative purposes.
    Ethical Considerations: Highlights ethical concerns and legal implications related to the use of keylogging technology.
